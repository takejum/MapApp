# MapApp
it is an app consist of two view controllers.
In the first one, it shows the map and allows you to go around anywhere you want. And once you long tap somewhere, label down below will show you the name of the place and the address where it is.
In the next one, there are two textfields for you to type in longitude/latitude. Then once you hit the "OK" button below the textfield, it will take you back to the first page and show where you type on the map.
